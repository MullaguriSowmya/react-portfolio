  <h2>Internship/Work Experience</h2>
   <p>Frontend Intern at code geanious from may to september,During my internship at <strong>Codegenious</strong>, I worked as a frontend web development intern for 2 months where I gained hands-on experience in building dynamic and responsive user interfaces using <strong>React.js</strong>. I contributed to the development of internal tools and small client-facing applications. My daily tasks included designing reusable components, handling props and states, writing clean HTML/CSS code, and debugging JavaScript logic.
</p>
<p>
  I also collaborated with senior developers through GitHub for code reviews and project version control, which helped me improve my understanding of real-world development workflows. I was involved in using tools like <strong>VS Code, Git, GitHub, Vite, and Chrome DevTools</strong>.
